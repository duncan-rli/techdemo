There are two parts to the application, the server and the command line client.
The server is call server.  The command line interface is called "encdec".

To encrypt
	encdec e id "datatext"
		where e is to encrypt
	             id to identify data

this will return the key required to decrypt the data, and can be redirected to a file

	encdec e id "data" > key.txt


To decrypt	
	encdec d id key
		where d is to decrypt
		      id to identify data
		      key to unlock data

with the key from a file
	encdec d id < key.txt
or with the key as a parameter
	encdec d id Key :[xx xx xx xx xx...]
